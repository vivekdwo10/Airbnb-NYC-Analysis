# Airbnb-NYC-Analysis

I have applied a range of crucial data analysis skills to analyze the NYC Airbnb dataset, extracting valuable insights and trends.

About Dataset - Welcome to New York City (NYC), one of the most vibrant and bustling cities in the world. As a global hub, NYC attracts millions of visitors each year, leading to a high demand for temporary lodging ranging from short-term stays to extended accommodations.

Data Importing & Cleaning - Used various techniques to import and clean data from diverse sources including .xlsx and .csv files. Ensured data accuracy by formatting dates and cleaning strings.

Data Exploration & Analysis: Utilized Pandas methods like head(), describe(), and info() to gain deeper insights into the dataset. Analyzed listing prices, price ranges by NYC borough, and compared costs with the private rental market.

Feature Engineering - Created new columns to highlight important features, enhancing the dataset for further analysis.

Data Cleaning - Eliminated unnecessary data, ensured correct data types (str, int, category), and removed NULL or NA values to maintain data integrity.

Data Merging & Aggregation - Merged multiple DataFrames from different sources and aggregated data for comprehensive analysis.

Project Insights - Discovered that the average price per night for an Airbnb listing in NYC is $141.82, with monthly costs averaging $4313.61, compared to $3,100.00 in the private market. Explored borough-wise price ranges and provided key summary statistics.
